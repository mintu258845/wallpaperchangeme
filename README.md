# Wallpaper Changer
some little software to change your dekstop background with custom jpgs or bmps randomly..

you will only have to have a Wallpaper directory next to your executable, where you store your 
image files..
Right now there are only jpgs and bmps supported, but I could change that.

Edit:
you have to create a folder called "Wallpapers" for this to work and put your wallpapers into this folder.
You also have to put the program ".exe" besides this new folder,but from there you can add the ".exe"
to your task bar or have a desktop link or something like that.
